# Ideo---Zadanie 
--Ideo Recruitment Task
So, I've coded this static website from a PSD file as a recruitment task for Ideo company. Let me shortly describe my work for You. 
First I've cutted from PSD file all needed images. Then I've drawed plan for myself how to position all elements on the website. 
Then I've started to code. I've decided to use mainly CSS Grid but also in some places I've used Flexbox model. To handle 
some small needed functionality on the page, I've used pure JavaScript. 
Page shows correctly on width of: 1920px and 1366px. 
Estimated working time: about 3 hour. 
I hope it will be enough to start gaining some experience from Ideo specialists :)
